# Pipeline
A pipeline is the process and tools we will use to get from start to finish of a project.
This includes standardized methods of working with files, nameing conventions, file locations, version control, working together on the same scene with multiple people, rendering, compositing, and VFX.

Pipelines are different from project to project and company to company.

Outside the world of CG there are lots of pipelines
- factory lines
- mcdonalds system
