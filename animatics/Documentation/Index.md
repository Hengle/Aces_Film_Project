# Home page


This is the homepage for the Aces project cinematic.

The goals of the project are to create a photoreal rendered space cinematic based on the world and cinematic of the game Spaces Aces being developed by the senior team at UVU. To do this we will use Houdini and whatever render engine we can get working on the render farm.

We will be using primarily an HDA workflow to avoid git conflicts.

we will render out and plan scenes with compositing in mind.

it will be a way to create a few cool VFX shots and motion graphicey shots while telling a small story.

It won't be longer than a minute.
