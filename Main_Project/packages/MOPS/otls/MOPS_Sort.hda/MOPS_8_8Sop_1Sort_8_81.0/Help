"""Fixes the sorting order of packed primitives and points to match ID attributes."""

MOPs Sort is intended to fix the sort order of geometry streams that get mismatched. This can happen via a stray Sort SOP, or because of unexpected geometry being merged into the geometry stream. If your MOPs operations seem to be affecting the wrong points, MOPs Sort can often fix the problem.

Rebuild ID From Name:
    #id: rebuild_id
    Use the trailing number from the s@name attribute to define the new i@id attribute. This can be useful if your original point IDs were lost during certain RBD simulations, for example.
