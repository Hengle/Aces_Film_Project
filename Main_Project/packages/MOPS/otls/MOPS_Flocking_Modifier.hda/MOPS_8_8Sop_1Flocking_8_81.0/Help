"""Moves instances in a swarm like fashion."""

This node uses boids rules to move instances in a swarm like behaviour.

It uses this implementation of boids: http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html

== Overview ==

@inputs

Packed Primitives:
    Plug in MOPs instances in here.
    
Guid Spline:
    Plug in a spline (polyline) to use as animation curve for follow position.

@parameters

== General ==

Reset Simulation:
    #id: resimulate

    Reset the whole simulation.
    
Start Frame:
    #id: startframe

    Start frame of simulation.

Sub Steps:
    #id: substeps

    Simulation sub steps (how many subframes to calculate per frame).
    
Cache Simulation:
    #id: cacheenabled

    Store simulation in RAM / HDD.
    
Allow caching to disk:
    #id: cachetodisk

    Allow cachedata to be also stored on HDD.
    
Cache Memory (MB):
    #id: cachemaxsize

    Max. alowed cache size.
    
== Boids Settings ==

"""Tandency to move towards the center of mass of the whole swarm"""

Move To Center:
    #id: Weight_Move_To_Center

== Avoid Each Other ==
"""Individual instances try to avoid each other"""

Repell:
    #id: repell_weight

    Strength of repulsion instances experience when close to each other.
    
Repell Distance:
    #id: repelldist

    Only instances within this distance to each other repell each other.
    
Angle of Influence:
    #id: angle_of_influence

    Only instances within this heading angle repell each other.

== Curl Noise ==

Noise Strength:
    #id: noise_strength

    Strength of curl noise's influence.
    
Freq:
    #id: freq

    Curl noise frequency.
    
Offset:
    #id: offset

    Curl noise offset.
    
Amp:
    #id: amp

    Curl noise amplitude.
    
== Clamp Velocity ==
"""Clamps the velocity to a given value"""    
    
Max Velocity:
    #id: Max_Vel

    Maximum length of velocity (max. speed).
    
== Follow Target Spline ==
"""Clamps the velocity to a given value"""

Follow Target Strength:
    #id: follow_target_strength
    
    Strength of insatnce's tendency to move towards a target point on a spline.
    
Position on Spline (0...1):
    #id: position_on_spline
    
    Position of target point on spline. 0 = Start of spline. 1 = End of spline.
