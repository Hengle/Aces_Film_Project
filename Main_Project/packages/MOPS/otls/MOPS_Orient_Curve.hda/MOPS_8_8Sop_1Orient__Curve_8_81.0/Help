"""Creates a stable orientation frame on a curve and stores it as p@orient."""

This node uses the Parallel Transport algorithm to compute a stable orientation frame on a curve. This algorithm generates
predictable and consistent orientations along curves, avoiding common problems like flipping when the curve loops back on itself.

This node generates the attribute p@orient. It can optionally output the vectors used to create the orient attribute:
mops_PT_normal, mops_PT_tangent, and mops_PT_binormal.

@inputs

Input Curve:
    The curve to process.
    
@parameters

Invert Normal:
    #id: invert
    Invert the normal (and binormal) of the computed matrix. In MOPs terms, this would flip the "up" vector of the curve.
    
Custom First Tangent:
    #id: custom_first_tangent
    Explicitly define the starting tangent of the curve, rather than using the implied tangent. For most curves you can leave this option off.
    
First Tangent:
    #id: First_Tangent
    The tangent vector to use as the starting tangent of the algorithm, if Custom First Tangent is enabled.
    
Remove Temporary Attrs:
    #id: remove_temp
    Removes the mops_PT_normal, mops_PT_tangent, and mops_PT_binormal attributes to leave only the orient attribute.
    This is only provided for convenience and does not change the output of the algorithm.
    
Twist Amount:
    #id: twist_amount
    The total amount of twist (in degrees) to apply over the curve, along the tangents. 
    
Twist Ramp:
    #id: twist_ramp
    A scalar on the twist applied over the length of the curve. The left side is the start of the curve and the right is the end.
