"""Moves instances along a guide spline."""

This moves instances along a guide spline (polyline).

== Overview ==

@inputs

Packed Primitives:
    Plug in MOPs instances in here.
    
Spline:
    Plug in a spline (polyline) to use as guide to move instances.

@parameters

== General ==

Mode:
    #id: mode

    How to move the instaces.
    - Simple: Moves instances along the spline direction.
    - Advect: Moves instances along the spline direction using advection (resmapling th spline direction along the way).
    - Trail (Points): Advect instances and generate point trails.
    - Trail (Spline): Advect instances and generate spline trails.
    
Overall Effect Scale:
    #id: amp

    General strength of motion.

Delete Instances (Keep Points Only):
    #id: delprims

    Deletes instances while keeping points/trails only.
    
Orient Instances:
    #id: do_orient

    Orients instances according to their direction of travel.
    
== Trail Settings ==  
    
Advection Steps:
    #id: advsteps

    Max numver of advection steps that instances take while being moved along spline direction.

Scale Falloff:
    #id: scalefalloff

    Multiplies existing falloff value by position relative to guide spline.
    
Overwrite Falloff:
    #id: overwritefalloff

    Sets existing falloff value to 1.0 before scaling.
    
== Resample Spline ==
"""Spline resampling. Identical controls as Houdini's resample SOP."""

Resample Spline:
    #id: resamplespline

    Enable spline resampling.
