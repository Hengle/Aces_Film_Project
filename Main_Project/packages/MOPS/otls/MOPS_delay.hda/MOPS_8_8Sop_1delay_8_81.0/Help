"""Delays upstream transformations on objects."""

The MOPs Delay modifier delays changes to attributes upstream based on the value of the @mops_falloff attribute. The delay currently applies to the internal transform attributes of packed primitives, plus Cd (color).

== Overview ==

@inputs

Input MOPs Primitives:
    The MOPs clones you want to delay transformations on.
    
@parameters

== General ==

Delay Amount:
    #id: delay
    The maximum number of seconds to delay (assuming @mops_falloff=1.0).
    
Use Falloff:
    #id: use_falloff
    Enable the @mops_falloff attribute as a multiplier on the delay length (high falloff == longer delay).
  
Do Sequence Delay:
    #id: do_sequence_delay
    Delay the frame index of instanced Alembics/Packed Disk Sequences as well as the transform attributes.
    
Reset Delay Cache:
    Reset the internal solver used to compute the delay.
