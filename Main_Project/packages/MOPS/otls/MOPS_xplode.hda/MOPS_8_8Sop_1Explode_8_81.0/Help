"""Turns each polygon in a geometry into an individual MOPs instance."""

Known Limitations: This node can produce errors in Houdini's viewport shading of newly created MOPs instances.

If you'd like to use MOPs tools on a geometry's polygons, use this node to turn the geometry into individual MOPs instances.

== Overview ==

@inputs

Geometry:
    Plug in geometry that should be converted to instances in here.

@parameters

== General ==

Recalculate Input Normals:
    #id: docalcnorm

    Recalculates the geometry's input normals before converting geo to instances.
    
Preserve Falloff:
    #id: preservefalloff

    Preserves falloff values that exist on the input geometry's primitives (f@mops_falloff).
    
Manual Up Vector:
    #id: manual_up

    Use a manually set up vector to generate each individual instance's local coordinate system.
    
Up Vector:
    #id: Up_Vector

    Up Vector to use when calculating instance's local coordinate system..
    
Invert Normal:
    #id: doinvertnormal

    Invert instance's normal.
