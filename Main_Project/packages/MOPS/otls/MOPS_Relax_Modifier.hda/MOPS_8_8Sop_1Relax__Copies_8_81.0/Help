"""Relaxes instances iteratively so they do not intersect."""

This node moves instances iteratively until their bounds (inscribed sphere) do not overlap.

== Overview ==

@inputs

Packed Primitives:
    Plug in MOPs instances in here.

@parameters

== General ==

Auto Compute Point Radius:
    #id: autoaxis
    Automatically estimate the point radius of each instance based on the longest bounding box axis.
    
Point Radius Axis:
    #id: axis
    If Auto Compute Point Radius is disabled, use this local axis to determine the point radius of each instance.

Stick To Surface:
    #id: sticktosurface

    Makes instances stick to a geometry's surface.
    
Surface to stick to:
    #id: objpath1

    Surface to stick instances to.
    
Reorient to Surface:
    #id: stick_reorient
    Reorient instances to follow the surface normals of the new position on the surface.
    
Use Falloff:
    #id: input
    
    Use falloff attribute to control how strongly instances will be relaxed (moved).
    
Max Iterations:
    #id: maxiterations
    
    Relaxation is an iterative process. This specifies how many relax iterations should be executed.
    
Radius Scale:
    #id: radius
    
    Scales the instance's boundary. 
    
Relax in 3D Space:
    #id: relaxin3d
    
    Move instances around in 3D space (not constrained to Normal direction or surface) to relax them.
    
Use Normal Attribute:
    #id: usenormals
    
    Use instance's normal attribute to generate direction in which instance will be moved.
    
Normal Direction:
    #id: normal
    
    Manual override if no normal attribute exists.
