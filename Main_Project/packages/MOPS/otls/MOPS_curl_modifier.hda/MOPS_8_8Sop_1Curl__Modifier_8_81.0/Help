"""Moves instances along a curl noise field"""

This node uses the falloff value to move instances through a curl noise field. It offers different modes for also generating trialing points or splines.

MOPs is based on a falloff value (usually in the range of 0-1). The falloff value controls how strongly instances will be affected by modifiers.

Packed Primitives:
    Plug in MOPs instances in here.

@parameters

== General ==

Mode:
    #id: curlmode

    Select how instances will be moved through curl noise field.
    - Simple: simply move instances in the direction of the curl vector.
    - Trail (Points): Advect instances through curl noise field and generate point trails.
    - Trail (Lines): Advect instances through curl noise field and generate polyline trails.
    - Advect: Advect instances through curl noise field over time (hit play to see effect).
    
Overall Effect Scale:
    #id: overallamp

    Dial in strength of effect.
    
Orient Instances:
    #id: orientclones
    
    Orient instances according to their motion through curl noise field.
    
Add To Existing Orientation:
    #id: addtrans
    
    Applies the orientation in addition to any pre-existing orientation.
    
Delete Instances (Keep Trail Only):
    #id: delclones
    
    Deletes any instances, leaving only the newly generated trial. 
    
== Curl Noise Properties ==
    
Amplitude:
    #id: curlamp
    
    Curl noise Amplitude.
    
Frequency:
    #id: curlfreq
    
    Curl noise Frequency.
    
Offset:
    #id: curloffset
    
    Curl noise Offset.
    
== Trail Settings ==
    
Advection Steps:
    #id: advectionsteps
    
    Max. number of advection steps.
    
Scale Falloff Along Trail:
    #id: scalefalloff
    
    Scales existing falloff value along advected trail.
    (Multiplies the pre-existing falloff value by curve position.)
    
Overwrite Falloff:
    #id: overwritefalloff
    
    Sets falloff value to 1.
    Gets applied before scaling of falloff value along trail (if enabled).
