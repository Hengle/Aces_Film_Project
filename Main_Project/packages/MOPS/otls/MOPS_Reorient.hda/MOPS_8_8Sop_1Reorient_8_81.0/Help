""" Changes the orientation frame of MOPs packed primitives without actually rotating the primitives. """

MOPs Reorient can be used to change the local orientation frame of MOPs primitives without moving them, so that primitives can be transformed around axes other than those they were originally defined with.
This SOP creates the p@mops_orient attribute.

== Overview ==

@inputs

Packed Primitives:
    The input MOPs primitives to reorient.
    
Reference Geo:
    A mesh or set of points with the orientation you want to transfer.
    
== Reference Geometry ==

@parameters

Compute Normal:
    #id: do_compute_N
    Generate a normal attribute on the input geometry.
    
Create Up Vector:
    #id: create_up_vector
    Generate an up attribute on the input geometry.
    
Up Vector:
    #id: up_vector
    The up vector to create, if enabled.
    
== Orient Transfer ==

Transfer Method:
    #id: transfer_method
    The method by which the generated orient attribute is transferred from the mesh/points to the MOPs primitives.
        * Interpolated: The attribute is transferred via Attribute Transfer SOP.
        * Matching Points: The attribute is copied from the source geometry to the MOPs primitives by point id.
