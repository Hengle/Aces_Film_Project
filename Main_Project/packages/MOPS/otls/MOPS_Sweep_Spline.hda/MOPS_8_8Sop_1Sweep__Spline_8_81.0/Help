"""Sweeps a crossection along a backbone to create geometry."""

This node creates a sweep spline using a cross section (closed polygon) and a backbone (polyline).

== Overview ==

@inputs

Crosssection:
    Cross section of resulting sweep.
    
Backbone:
    Path to sweep cross section along.
    
@parameters

== General ==

Show Backbone:
    #id: docalcnorm

    Recalculates the geometry's input normals before converting geo to instances.
    
Resample Backbone:
    #id: preservefalloff

    Preserves falloff values that exist on the input geometry's primitives (f@mops_falloff).

== Sweep Controls ==
"""Controls the appearance of the resulting geometry."""

== Spline Start & End ==
"""Controls where geometry starts and ends (relative to backbone)."""

Start:
    #id: domainu1

    Start of sweep.
    
End:
    #id: domainu2

    End of sweep.

== Twist ==
"""Rotates cross section while sweeping along backbone."""
    
Ramp Twist:
    #id: ramp_twist

    Ramp to control cross section's rotation.
    
Rotation Min:
    #id: destmin

    Rotation at beginning of spline (degrees).
    
Rotation Max:
    #id: destmax

    Rotation at end of spline (degrees).
    
Rotation Offset:
    #id: input2

    Offset of rotation at beginning of spline (degrees).
    
== Scale ==
"""Scales cross section while sweeping along backbone."""
    
Ramp Scale:
    #id: scale

    Ramp to control cross section's scale.
    
Rotation Min:
    #id: destmin2

    Scale at beginning of spline.
    
Rotation Max:
    #id: destmax2

    Scale at end of spline.
    
Rotation Offset:
    #id: input3

    Offset of Scale at beginning of spline.  
    
== Extend Spline ==
"""Extends backbone past its beginngin/end by using spline's tangent."""

Extend Spline:
    #id: switchextend

    Enable spline extension.
    
Elongate Spline:
    #id: domainu2

    Length of segments to add.
    
== Keep Pscale & Orient ==
"""Allows to keep Pscale & Orient if those attributes exist on input backbone."""

Keep Pscale Attribute:
    #id: keeppscale

    Keep Pscale.
    
Keep Orient Attribute:
    #id: keeporient

    Keep orient.
