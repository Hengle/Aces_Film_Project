"""Applies a falloff value using primitive shapes."""

MOPs is based on a falloff value (usually in the range of 0-1). The falloff value controls how strongly instances will be affected by modifiers.
This node sets the falloff value on MOPs instances using basic primitive shapes:
- Sphere
- Box
- Torus
- Cylinder
- Linear Ramp

== Overview ==

@inputs

Packed Primitives:
    Plug in MOPs instances in here.
    
Falloff Transforms:
    If you'd like to transform (move, scale, rotatet) your falloff, you can plug in a MOPs Transform Falloff node in here.

@parameters

== General ==

Show Helper Geo:
    #id: input

    Toggle wireframe display of primitive shape used to generate falloff.

Visualize Falloff:
    #id: vis_switch

    Colorize instances to show falloff values.
    
Mode:
    #id: shapemode_switch

    Select which primitive Shape to use to generate falloff.
    
Blend Mode:
    #id: blendmode
    
    Select how to apply falloff values (Set, Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).
    
Clamp Falloff Values:
    #id: clamp
    
    Clamps falloff to values in the range of 0-1.    
    
== Sphere ==

"""Applies a spherical falloff to instances."""

Radius:
    #id: radius
    
    Sphere Radius.
    
Falloff:
    #id: falloff
    
    How broad the falloff will be. A value of 1 will result in a linear falloff from the sphere's center to its radius. A value of 0 will result in instances within the sphere being set to 1.
    
Remap Falloff:
    #id: spline
    
    Remap falloff values according to ramp.
    
== Linear == 

"""Applies a linear falloff to instances."""

Length:
    #id: length
    
    Length of linear gradient ramp.
    
Falloff:
    #id: falloff2
    
    How broad the falloff will be. A value of 1 will result in a linear falloff from start to end.
    
Remap Falloff:
    #id: spline2
    
    Remap falloff values according to ramp.
    
== Box == 

"""Applies a box shaped falloff to instances."""

Size:
    #id: size
    
    Box Size.
    
Falloff:
    #id: falloff3
    
    How broad the falloff will be. A value of 1 will result in a linear falloff from start to end. A value of 0 will result in instances within the box being set to 1.
    
Remap Falloff:
    #id: spline3
    
    Remap falloff values according to ramp.
    
== Torus == 

"""Applies a toroidally shaped falloff to instances."""

Size:
    #id: size2
    
    Torus Size.
    
Falloff:
    #id: falloff4
    
    How broad the falloff will be. A value of 1 will result in a linear falloff from start to end. A value of 0 will result in instances within the torus being set to 1.
    
Remap Falloff:
    #id: spline4
    
    Remap falloff values according to ramp.
    
== Cylinder == 

"""Applies a cylindrically shaped falloff to instances."""

Size:
    #id: size3
    
    Cylinder Size.
    
Falloff:
    #id: falloff5
    
    How broad the falloff will be. A value of 1 will result in a linear falloff from start to end. A value of 0 will result in instances within the cylinder being set to 1.
    
Remap Falloff:
    #id: spline5
    
    Remap falloff values according to ramp.
    
== Noise ==    
    
Add Noise:
    #id: donoise
    
    Mixes in noise to the falloff (similar to dithering a gradient ramp).
    
Noise Type:
    #id: basis
    
    Select which noise type to use.    
    
Amplitude:
    #id: noiseamp
    
    Overall noise strength.    
    
Frequency:
    #id: freq
    
    How quickly the noise value fluctuates. Higher frequency values mean smaller noise patterns.
    
Offset:
    #id: offset
    
    Translates the noise in space.
    
Fractal:
    #id: fractal
    
    Adds seccondary detail to noise.
    
Ramp Noise:
    #id: ramp_noise
    
    Remap the noise values depending on a ramp.
