It's really important that every team member be strict in their organization and follow the standards set for folder structure. If these aren't followed team projects quickly degrade into chaos.

It is critical we use relative paths for everything. And if referencing objects outside the HIP file that we use $JOB as reference. This will prevent path breaks when using the render farm.

# Version Control

Version control is very important in group projects. 
For one it helps to midigate catastrophic erros or problems, and assists with team collaberation accross the internet.

[[Version Control]]

Because we are using version control please turn off auto backups in your houdini project.
